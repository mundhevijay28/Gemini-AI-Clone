# Gemini-AI-Clone
Gemini-AI-Clone is a fully functional clone of Gemini AI, developed using React.js and Vite. It mimics the conversational AI features of Gemini, enabling users to interact with a chatbot that processes inputs and provides real-time responses. This project is perfect for developers who want to explore AI-driven chat interfaces or build their own AI-powered assistant applications.

## Key Features
**AI-Powered Conversations**:
Gemini-AI-Clone responds to user prompts in real-time using dynamic content rendering.
**Prompt History:**
Users can view recent prompts and quickly reselect them for faster interaction.
**Fast and Optimized:**
Powered by Vite, providing fast build times, instant server start, and hot module replacement (HMR).
**Responsive Design:**
The UI adapts to all screen sizes, offering a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
**Loading Indicator:**
Visual indicators during AI processing for improved user interaction feedback.

**Project Demo**
Here’s a demo of the project showcasing the core functionality and features.


## Tech Stack
**Frontend:**
**React.js **– for building a dynamic and interactive user interface.

**Bundling/Build Tool:**
**Vite** – for ultra-fast development server, optimized builds, and hot module replacement.

**State Management:**
**Context API** – for managing global state across components and handling prompts, responses, and loading states.

**CSS:**
Custom styling for a polished, modern UI.

##Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

**1. Clone the repository**
'git clone https://github.com/mundhevijay28/Gemini-AI-Clone.git'

**2. Navigate to the project directory**
'cd Gemini-AI-Clone'

**3. Install dependencies**
'npm install'

**4. Run the development server**
'npm run dev'

This will start the Vite development server. You can now open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the application.

## How It Works

**User Interface:**
The main interface allows users to enter prompts, select recent prompts, and view responses dynamically.
**State Management:**
The application uses the Context API to manage the conversation state, handling user inputs, recent prompts, and AI responses.
**AI Processing:**
After a user enters a prompt, the application simulates sending the prompt to an AI engine and rendering a response on the UI.
